# Fe-based Amorphous Alloys ML Project
This repository contains machine learning models for predicting properties of Fe-based amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys.

## ðŸ“Š Data & Features
- **Target Properties**: Grain size (GS), ribbon thickness (RT), saturation magnetic flux density (Bs), coercivity (Hc), crystallization onset temperature (Tx1 and Tx2), etc.
- **Features**: Elemental composition (Fe, B, Cu, Nb, etc.), annealing temperature (TA), annealing time (tA), heating rate (HR).
